# deployScript

While toying around with a number of Python scripts, I found myself doing `cut and paste` when I copy my scripts from a central locations where I have all my code to a common library where I keep my scripts. On top of that, I also found myself manually creating the `.bat` files before I can run them. 

This script is created to allow easy deployment of Python scripts using TKinter to any other location within you Windows PC. 

## Documentation

This script will perform the following:

1. Allows the selection of the Source and Target location of the python script(s). Note that only `.py` files will be copied over.
2. Gives the user the option to delete the contents of the Target location.
3. Gives the user the option to automatically create a `.bat` file.

## Installation

Clone this GitHub repository to install and run the script.

$ git clone https://github.com/alanbantug/deployScript.git
